# Research Background

My research has been [published](publications) in journals such as *Frontiers in Plant Science*, *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, *The Plant Phenome Journal*, and *Journal of Open Source Education*. I have also been featured in media outlets including the *Wall Street Journal* (see video below), [Seed World](https://seedworld.com/how-the-night-sky-helped-emmanuel-gonzalez-love-plant-breeding/), and [CyVerse News](https://cyverse.org/plants-robots-and-other-interesting-things). My [work](research) explores the variation and temporal basis of adaptive traits in crops such as lettuce, sorghum, and cotton using a range of methods including linear mixed models, machine learning, computer vision, distributed computing, container technology, and geospatial analysis. I have [taught](teaching) courses on cyberinfrastructure, computing technologies, applied machine learning, and biotechnology.

# Family Background

My grandfather’s journey to the United States began with the [Bracero program](https://www.labor.ucla.edu/what-we-do/research-tools/the-bracero-program/), which brought him from Mexico to work in the agricultural fields around El Centro, CA. His hard work and determination eventually led to citizenship for himself and his family. My mother, inspired by his example, overcame language barriers and the challenges of being a single mother to earn an A.S degree and open her own daycare center.

Their perseverance and ambition instilled in me a desire to reach for the stars. As a child, I was fascinated by astronomy and spent countless hours gazing at the night sky with my telescope and stargazer’s book. My family’s background in agriculture also influenced my decision to pursue plant science during my undergraduate studies. A research experience at the Boyce Thompson Institute further reinforced my passion for this field.

Now, as the first in my family to pursue a PhD, I am driven by a desire to challenge myself, make the most of the opportunities available to me, and serve as a role model for young Latinx minds. I am grateful for the giants on whose shoulders I stand and strive to honor their legacy through my hard work and dedication.
