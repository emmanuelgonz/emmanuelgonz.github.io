Welcome/Bienvenido! My life has taught me that growth often comes from discomfort. I embrace this by seeking out challenges that push me beyond my perceived limits. This approach has allowed me to develop a diverse set of transdisciplinary skills. Today, I am a hybrid: part data scientist, part plant scientist.

I am currently a Research Scientist in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University. My research focuses on developing computational frameworks for scientific research, including the [New Observing Strategies Testbed (NOS-T)](https://github.com/code-lab-org/nost-tools), a digital engineering environment to test and develop observing strategies.

Prior to joining ASU, I received my B.S. in Biology from [Pacific Lutheran University](https://www.plu.edu/). My passion for plant science was sparked in the forests of Washington state and grew during a summer internship at [Dr. Jim Giovannoni's lab](https://btiscience.org/jim-giovannoni/) at the [Boyce Thompson Institute](https://btiscience.org/). Shortly after, I became a member of the [Pauli lab](https://thepaulilab.com/) at the [University *of* Arizona's School of Plant Sciences](https://cals.arizona.edu/spls/home), where I worked with data from the [Field Scanalyzer](https://news.arizona.edu/story/world-s-largest-robotic-field-scanner-now-place). My expertise includes plant phenomics, scientific computing, and applied machine learning. My interest in data science began early in my graduate studies and grew as I taught myself computer programming and developed computational frameworks. These skills allowed me to explore research questions that were once unanswerable due to a lack of data or a lack of methods for extracting information from data.

My research has been [published](publications) in journals such as *Frontiers in Plant Science*, *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, *The Plant Phenome Journal*, and *Journal of Open Source Education*. I have also been featured in media outlets including the *Wall Street Journal* (see video below), [Seed World](https://seedworld.com/how-the-night-sky-helped-emmanuel-gonzalez-love-plant-breeding/), and [CyVerse News](https://cyverse.org/plants-robots-and-other-interesting-things). My [work](research) explores the variation and temporal basis of adaptive traits in crops such as lettuce, sorghum, and cotton using a range of methods including linear mixed models, machine learning, computer vision, distributed computing, container technology, and geospatial analysis. I have [taught](teaching) courses on cyberinfrastructure, computing technologies, applied machine learning, and biotechnology.
